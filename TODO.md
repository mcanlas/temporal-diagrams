- - diagram the framework itself
- multi arrows in v2
  - with callback; earlier bound evidence
- encode heterogeneous payloads
- highlight framework orthogonal to encoding; not a function of the target language
- evolution narrative for payloads
- slideshow narrative (to supplant temporal indexing and support combinators/combinations i.e. "highlight these two", highlight as composible feature flags)
- should highlight by component be done with the tagged versions themselves (instead of asking to retype the string key)
- partially applied dialect to minimize dialect pollution with multiple rendering avenues
- multiple output dialects (plantuml is just one)
- ability to "highlight" areas, and dim others
  - not just one, could be multiple
  - if no highlights provided, render everything vibrant
- component has ordinal index. if < global current index, then render this?
  - purpose: to produce slides in time
- dependsOn loops (ease of one to many)
- dialects
  - how much of this machinary is abstract from the domain
  - how far can we go without saying kinesis/microservice
- what is the fundamental unit? a non empty list of renderables, each a list?
- the current data structure must be iterated upon/folded into the canvas
  - declaring singletons and avoiding duplicates (first one wins)
  - can we avoid having to pre-declare things? does the sum of all relationships satisfy a global registry
  - what about singletons/islands, things with no relationship?
- are we just a semigroup of `Renderable[A]`
- a `Temporal[K : Ord, A]` is not directly renderable and must be reduced into a `Rendrable[A]` given some index `K`
- highlightable/identified structures, at minimum, must be keyed into (e.g. "highlight this component") and receive some boolean, whether or not they are in the highlight
  - may extend a base `Renderable[_]`
  - and two more states `renderHighlight(true/false)`, for ultimately ternary states
  - although in practice, the default global "no highlights" state would be similar as "all highlighted", all vibrant
  - caveat: in order for any ONE component to be highlightable, everything must be dimmable
- temporaral and highlight keys are different, independent axes
- when rendering subcomponents in a package, and applying highlighting to them... it's not possible, because the highlighting framework only works on wholly completed components. the subcomponents cannot be assigned different tags/highlights (think of different workflows like http controllers that are bound in one layer) 
- color math
- gradients
- Seq coercion and bundle type a la `scalatags`

## V2 features

- plantuml as target
- mermaid as target
